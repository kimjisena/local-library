# Backend Dev - ExpressJS

Hello there!

I'm using this repo to learn backend development using the tools 
that I'm already familiar with, namely NodeJS and NPM.

I'm using MDN's [server side programming tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side) as a guide.

**Tools**
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- Pug templating engine
- Bootstrap

**Live Project**
- play with the project [here](https://l0cal-library.herokuapp.com/)

## Takeaways

I totally enjoyed playing with ExpressJS and in particular, I like the "we're-hosting-but-come-with-your-own-drinks" ExpressJS philosophy. 
The level of freedom and flexibility that ExpressJS offers is just 
mind blowing!

Compared to Django (I first started my web dev journey with Django), it's perfection...pure heaven.

- You're not bound to a particular templating language
- You can build a RESTful API in a matter of seconds with zero config
- No context switching - bring your JavaScript knowlegde and you're all set
- Only install the tools you need
- No separate settings file i.e your project settings are built into the app
- Structure your project in the best way that works for you
